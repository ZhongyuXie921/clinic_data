# Cancer Patient Data Analysis and Prediction

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis toolkit for cancer patient data, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), survival analysis, and predictive modeling. It generates synthetic patient data and performs various analyses to understand patterns in cancer progression, treatment outcomes, and survival rates.

## Features
- Synthetic cancer patient data generation with realistic correlations
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations:
  - Age distribution by gender
  - Cancer type distribution by stage
  - Survival analysis by tumor size
  - Treatment outcome analysis
- Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
- Machine learning-based survival prediction using Random Forest
- Automated visualization generation and storage
